Context

The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) was established to pioneer the study of gravitational-wave astrophysics through the direct observation of gravitational waves — a phenomenon predicted by Einstein’s General Theory of Relativity. LIGO’s large-scale detectors, stretching over several kilometers, employ laser interferometry to capture incredibly small distortions in space-time produced by powerful cosmic occurrences such as the collision of neutron stars or black holes, as well as supernova explosions. The observatory operates two major interferometers located across the United States — one in Hanford, Washington, and the other in Livingston, Louisiana — working simultaneously to identify these gravitational disturbances.

This dataset comprises images from LIGO that were categorized through the Gravity Spy project on Zooniverse.
